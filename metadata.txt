description= Generate SWMM input files from layers and import input files from SWMM to QGIS
version=0.24
author=Jannik Schilling
email=jannik.schilling@posteo.de

about=This plugin provides tools to generate SWMM input files from layers in QGIS, and to import SWMM input files into QGIS. Exemplary data with all fields are provided and can be added to a QGIS project with the first tool. The plugin needs the python libraries 'pandas' and 'openpyxl' (for the import tool) which should be included in current QGIS versions. If they are not already installed, they can be added in a advanced QGIS installation or via pip. Instructions and a documentation can be found on the pluginÂ´s GIT (see link "homepage" below).
