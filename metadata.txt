description= Generate SWMM input files from layers and import input files from SWMM to QGIS

about=This plugin provides tools to generate SWMM input files from layers in QGIS, and to import SWMM input files into QGIS. You can create submodels above or below a certain node in your model layers. The plugin needs the python library 'pandas' which should be included in current QGIS versions. If it is not already installed, it can be added in a advanced QGIS installation or via pip. Instructions and a documentation can be found on the plugin´s GIT (see link "homepage" below).

	First versions of this plugin have been developed within the project PROSPER-RO, funded by BMBF, grant number 033L212.

	- removal of "openpyxl" due to several crashes
	- updated processing feedback
	- replacement of column "Shape" by "XsectShape" in conduits layers and orifices layers. Currently, a deprecation warning will appear and the tools will still work with old SWMM layers. However it is recommended to apply these changes from now on.
