description= Generate SWMM input files from layers and import input files from SWMM to QGIS
version=0.28

about=This plugin provides tools to generate SWMM input files from layers in QGIS, and to import SWMM input files into QGIS. You can create submodels above or below a certain node in your model layers. The plugin needs the python libraries 'pandas' and 'openpyxl' (for the import tool) which should be included in current QGIS versions. If they are not already installed, they can be added in a advanced QGIS installation or via pip. Instructions and a documentation can be found on the plugin´s GIT (see link "homepage" below).
